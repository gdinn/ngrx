# NgRx Study

This repository is a study that is on progress about ngrx. The knowledge source is the course "NgRx (with NgRx data)" from Angular University.

I am using the local web server of the original example repo. Aside that, the code here is my interpretation of the content with some improvements that I saw fit.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Local REST server

Run `npm run server` for a local REST server. Make requests to `http://localhost:9000/`. The app is already configured to proxy the requests to this address.
